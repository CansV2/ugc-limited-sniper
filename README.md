before you use make sure you have python 3.10. If you do not look up python 3.10 installer and scroll all the way down and click windows installer 3.10.
whenever u install it in the setup screen it will say at the bottom left something like 'add python to PATH" click that and then continue with the installation.

DM me if u need help
