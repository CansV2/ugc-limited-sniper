This is a ugc limited sniper project that collects free roblox ugcs.
First, click the "code" button at the top right and then click "Download ZIP"
then you will run the file inside the folder called "bot.py" 
after you do this it will either ask you for a item ID to snipe or it will just crash. 
if it crashes do pip install requests and then pip install Crypto.
If it continues to crash than DM me
